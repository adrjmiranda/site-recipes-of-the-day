# Site Recipes of The Day

This is a simple website design that recipes the DAO pattern, which is a pattern for applications implemented with object-oriented programming languages and MVC architecture. And that data persist, where there is separation of business rules from database access rules. And yet, where all database functionality, such as getting connections, mapping objects to SQL data types, or executing SQL commands, must be performed by DAO classes.
